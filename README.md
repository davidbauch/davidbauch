# 👋 Hi, I’m @davidbauch
- 👀 I’m interested in physics, coding, and tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently a PHD student in physics. I'm interested in learning C/C++, Python, and maybe other languages.

# Stuff I did:

These are some of the projects I created during work or for fun in my free time.

## [Quantum Simulation Program QDaCC](https://github.com/davidbauch/QDaCC)

A quantum simulation solving Lindblad-type systems using the density matrix approach and the von Neuman equation. The code contains beautiful gradients of both old and new code for a beautiful display of my learning curve [I deleted most of the bad code :)].

Main language: `C++`

### [Utility Toolbox](https://github.com/davidbauch/QDaCC-Tools)

Set of helpful tools to evaluate and visualize results obtained from QDaCC. Ever used Excel to summarize and plot 200 datasets? Yeah, me neither.

Main Language: `Python`
  
### [Deticated GUI](https://github.com/davidbauch/QDaCC-Tools/tree/main/QDLC/gui)

User interface for QDaCC. Very helpful, enhances workflow by at least an order of magnitude.

Main Language: `Python, PyQT`

## [Polariton Condensate Simulation](https://github.com/davidbauch/PC3):

Polariton Condensates simulated on the PC² (Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing) -> PC³. This program uses GPU acceleration and is actually really quite fast.

Main Language: `CUDA, C++`


# Interesting Stuff

## [Eigenvalue Visualizer](https://github.com/davidbauch/eigenvalue_visualizer)

Main Language: `Python, Jupyter Notebook`

## [(Very old) Fractal Calculator](https://github.com/davidbauch/FractalSolver)

Yay, Mandelbrot!

Main Language: `C++`
